### Description

These are some very basic AutoHotKey scripts I wrote to make my life easier when commanding Dragonfall or The Silverwastes. I don't expect these to be useful to very many people but if you think you might want to use them I'm more than happy to take advice on improvements or commits from others.

*PS. - I like to game with others and do metas, gold farming, ect - so find me on Discord (Ian#3843) and we can game together :)*

## Instructions for use
- Set game to windowed mode
- Bind executable to mouse/keyboard key or add hotkey function to the script and start in while in game.
- The script will begin by simulating the `Return` key which will then expect you to type some key terms.
  - *Key terms are found below*
- When a key term is entered correctly the script will erase the text quickly and replace it with the full text prompt.
- Once the text has been entered, the script will end by simulating the `Return` again to put it into chat.
- All text goes to squad chat by default so even if you're whispering, talking with guild mates, or just not in squad chat - it will start by sending `/squad{Space}` to make sure it's selected.

#### Key Terms by Map
